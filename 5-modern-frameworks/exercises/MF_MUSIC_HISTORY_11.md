# Music History 11

## Prerequisite

> :warning: This exercise requires that you have completed the [Music History 10](MF_MUSIC_HISTORY_10.md) exercise.

## Setup

These commands are a helpful quick start. You may choose to ignore them completely and create your own directory structure. If you choose to use this recommendation, just copy the commands below and paste. It doesn't matter what directory you are currently in.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/musichistory
git checkout -b version-11
```

## Requirements

### Song List View

Now you will add the filtering form back into your Angularized Music History application that you did in version 10.

Use the built-in directives that Angular provides to display the list of albums and/or list of artists in your filter form. When the user selects an album or artist, filter the collection of songs that is being displayed based on the user's selection.
